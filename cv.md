## Briefly About Myself:

Greetings, Earthlings! I'm Daniil Troyanov, your friendly neighborhood aspiring Jedi Front-End Developer. My coding skills are sharper than a lightsaber, and I'm on a mission to turn caffeine into code. They say I'm fluent in both binary and sarcasm, and I believe that bugs are just undocumented features.

## Skills and Proficiency:

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code
- Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator (for when I need to design a pixel-perfect lightsaber)

## Code Examples

```
function greet() {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}
```

_Stay tuned for my master class, but it's on a "soonish" schedule._

## Work Experience

I once told a compiler a joke, and it laughed so hard that it generated a runtime error. That's why there's no official record of my work yet - I'm still debugging the universe.

## Education

They say knowledge is power, but I've got enough electricity in my code. Who needs formal education when you're on a first-name basis with Stack Overflow and have a black belt in coding katas?

## English Language
My English is at the A2 level, but trust me, the best jokes are yet to come. The language of programming is universal, and my code speaks volumes.
