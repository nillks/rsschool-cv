## Briefly About Myself:

Greetings, Earthlings! I'm Daniil Troyanov, your friendly neighborhood aspiring Jedi Front-End Developer. My coding skills are sharper than a lightsaber, and I'm on a mission to turn caffeine into code. They say I'm fluent in both binary and sarcasm, and I believe that bugs are just undocumented features.

## Skills and Proficiency:

- HTML5, CSS3
- JavaScript Basics
- Git, GitHub
- VS Code
- Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator (for when I need to design a pixel-perfect lightsaber)
